# Memory Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic memory card game. This project is currently on hold while I finish my in-browser IDE project. However, the basic game functionality is working. So if you don't mind the bright colors I'm using temporarily as an aid to work out the CSS, feel free to give it a try!
